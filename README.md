# Online-Flight-Booking-System
 While completing one of my major University courses I was told to complete this project which is Online Flight Management System. Here in this project for Front End language, I have used HTML and CSS and for Back End language I've used JS and PHP where PHP plays a major role. And here is the project. You might need to change the location of the images for making this project work. There are separate admin pages and booking pages. Password for the admin login panel is attached in the sql file.
